I want to learn and be challenged. My father is a software developer, I was always amazed by the walls of incomprehensible code that made my eyes blur and I wanted to know more. Because of this I’ve always been interested in how computers work, how websites are built and run. I love exploring and experiencing new things that open my eyes to newer, greater ways of thinking, which is why I got into web development because it ties my love of design with my curiosity for the web.
