overview: "Made using a pattern library, every pattern is coded in its own HTML file, in a pattern folder and draws from a CSS file in the pattern folder. To build each page, patterns are called out and pieced together with only minimal amounts of HTML to structure them."

research: "When I was initially tasked with creating an e-commerce site, I knew I wanted to create a t-shirt brand for some of the weird art that I have made in the past. I knew roughly who I wanted to target but didn't really know how or why. All my research was done to narrow down my target group and influence my decisions when the time came to start designing. All this research helped me create my website goal and strengthen my idea of how I wanted the site to be perceived."
target: "People who are fashion-forward and enjoy fashion. Usually both males and females between the ages of 16 - 28, who keep up to date on social media and enjoy expressing themselves through their fashion and appearance. Generally artistic and stylish, have a good sense of self. It uses bright fun colours that are also mature enough to draw the attention of young adults. Below are two personas of potential customers to the E-commerce site."

goal: "Mushroom Boy is a unisex t-shirt, hoodie and jacket shop. The goal is to sell a unique brand of clothing to people looking for unisex clothing. As well, the website should represent the brand and the stylistic choices should coincide with the appearance of the clothing."
urban: "Urban Outfitters"
abouttitle: "About"
about: "Urban Outfitters is a lifestyle retailer dedicated to inspiring customers through a unique combination of product, creativity and cultural understanding, offering experiential retail environments and a well-curated mix of on-trend women’s and men’s clothes, from boho dresses, denim and graphics to shoes, hats, and backpacks, as well as beauty, intimates, swim and a collection of handpicked vintage clothing."
audiencetitle: "Target Audience"
audience: "Teens and young adults who are into fashion."
strengthstitle: "Strengths"
strengths: "They have a very recognizable brand, they put a lot of effort into brand awareness and putting their brand forward in style. They try many new things and the site is pretty straight forward. They use clear descriptors for their clothing, clearly state any partnerships and what materials are used."
weaknessestitle: "Weaknesses"
weaknesses: "It is difficult to find an about page for them to explain their branding and style guide. Most online clothing stores give you at least a little bit of an idea of how they represent their brand and how they think their clothing should be styled. (their product cards include models wearing the clothing and showing off the unique styling which could be used for a lookbook but it would be nicer to have a real book)."
visual: "After I was done the research, I started thinking about how I wanted the site to feel. I wanted something modern but eye-catching. To achieve that I kept the site minimal in elements but added a lot of personality to the site."
type: |

Futura tied together all elements of the sites brand by not having a large amount of personality, this let the site speak for itself.</p>
