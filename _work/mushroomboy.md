audiencetitle: "Target Audience"
audience: "Teens and young adults who are into fashion."
strengthstitle: "Strengths"
strengths: "They have a very recognizable brand, they put a lot of effort into brand awareness and putting their brand forward in style. They try many new things and the site is pretty straight forward. They use clear descriptors for their clothing, clearly state any partnerships and what materials are used."
weaknessestitle: "Weaknesses"
weaknesses: " It is difficult to find an about page for them to explain their branding and style guide. Most online clothing stores give you at least a little bit of an idea of how they represent their brand and how they think their clothing should be styled. (their own product cards include models wearing the clothing and showing off the unique styling which could be used for a lookbook but it would be nicer to have a real book)"
