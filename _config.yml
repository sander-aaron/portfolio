  font_url: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora:400,400i,700|Raleway:400,500,600,700,800,900&display=swap"
  colors:
    accent: "--color-primary"
    patterns:
      brand.logos: "--color-primary-light"
  rationales:
    typefaces.primary: |
      Lora was selected as the primary typeface because it compliments the weight of Raleway. This will be used for body copy.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Raleway was selected as the secondary typeface because it is bold and has a lot of choices in font weight and has a lot of personality. This will be used for headings.
    colors.primary: |
      Having black and white as the primary colours keeps a clean feel and gives a good base to add in the accent colours.
    colors.secondary: |
      Yellow and blue were chose because there are bright but complimentary colours.
