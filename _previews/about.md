name: "Who am I?"
description: |
  I want to learn and be challenged. I love exploring and experiencing new things that open my eyes to newer, greater ways of thinking. Iâ€™ve always been interested in how computers work, how websites are built and run. My father is a software developer, I was always amazed by the walls of incomprehensible code that made my eyes blur and I wanted to know more. I got into web development because it ties my love of design with my curiosity for the web.
