      <p class="preview push-0">I want to learn and be challenged. I love exploring and experiencing new things that open my eyes to newer, greater ways of thinking. I’ve always been interested in how computers work, how websites are built and run. My father is a software developer, I was always amazed by the walls of incomprehensible code that made my eyes blur and I wanted to know more. I got into web development because it ties my love of design with my curiosity for the web.</p>
